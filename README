This is a seed project to use Java at back end and Angular at front end.
The purpose is to use Java for building RESTful api server and use Angular to consume that RESTful api.
I've used Eclipse for the development IDE. 
I've used Maven to create the project template. (File -> New -> Maven Project -> maven-archetype-webapp)
I've also used Tomcat v8.0.29 server.
